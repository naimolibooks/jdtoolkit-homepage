		<p>Aspiring children's book author, illustrator, cartoonist, graphic novelist, game designer and journalist. For the pen is mightier than the sword, and I hold it with honor. In my spare time, I work on three different children’s chapter book series, an informative one, an educational one, and a comical one. I also write multiple graphic novel series, a comic strip, and concepts for a virtual world and edutainment franchise. I am a dual degree student working towards an Illustration/Journalism + Design degree, planning on publishing my first title sometime in the 2020's. It's just what I do, and I enjoy it!</p>
